# CRISPR-Cas-System
## System CRISPR-Cas sequenced 
This repository includes sequenced  data for the determination of System CRISPR-Cas in strains of *Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii* complex

The base of data CRISPR-AB.txt includ the sequences of the system CRISPR-Cas.

The image CRISPR-AB show the spacers and repeated sequences for the system CRISPR-CAS IFb in  two strains of *A.baumannii*

The image SPACERS.JPG show the bioinformatics search on the CRISPR server, the sequences of the system CRISPR-Ifb have 10 spacers.

In addittion, the base of data OXA-51 includ  sequences of  *blaOXA-51* gene from the  *A. baumannii*, *A. nosocomialis* and *A. pittii* strains. The sequences analysis showed 100% identity.
