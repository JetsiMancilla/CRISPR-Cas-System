# CRISPR-Cas-System
## System CRISPR-Cas sequenced 
This repository includes sequenced  data for the determination of System CRISPR-Cas in strains of *A. baumannii*


The base of data CRISPR-AYE.text and CRISPR-AB.txt includ the sequences of the systems CRISPR-Cas.

The image CRISPR-AB show the spacers and repeated sequences for the system CRISPR-CAS IFb in  two strains of *A.baumannii*

The image SPACERS.JPG show the bioinformatics search on the CRISPR server, the sequences of the system CRISPR-Ifb have 10 spacers.
